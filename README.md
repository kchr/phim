Public Hotspot Internet Manager

CLI application for searching and managing sessions of known public wifi hotspots. 

The main idea is to liberate the user from having to use web interfaces to get access to public wifi networks, of the types often found at airports, trains, buses and shopping malls. 

Additional hotspots and their metadata feature definitions can be provided through a simple plugin framework.

**Feature list**

- Searching for known hotspots
- View detailed information about given hotspot
- Log in or out of (captive) web portals/jails
- Use NOOP methods to keep hotspot session alive and fresh
- Plugin framework for hotspot definitions

Please suggest any other features that could be of interest.
